# Doodle Diction

## To play (suggested 4-6 players):
1. One players hosts a room and shares the name with other players; the remaining players join that room.
2. Once all players are ready, the game begins.
3. For the first round, all players type an interesting or creative sentence, then submit.
4. During the second round, all players are shown a sentence written by a different player during the first round. The task now is to illustrate the sentence, and then submit.
5. During the next round all players will see a picture drawn by a different player the previous round. The task this time is to caption the picture with a descriptive sentence.
6. The game continues in this manner until the maximum number of rounds is reached. Then all of the original sentences are shown and everyone gets to see how the non-verbal games of "Telephone" progress!
